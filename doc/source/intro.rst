Introduction
=============================
``NonlinearRegression`` is a small suit of tools to perform nonlinear regression, `scikitlearn` style.
It uses linear regression and data transformation to perform unweighted nonlinear regression
and implements a version of function spaces as Hilbert spaces to do weighted nonlinear regression.

Also, has a simple class to cross validate time series when treated as a regression problem.
